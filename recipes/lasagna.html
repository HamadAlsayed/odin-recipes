            This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.
            Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.

        <h2>How to make Lasagna:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.
                 The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.
                 We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
            </li>
            <li>
                From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. 
                Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!
            </li>
        </ol>
