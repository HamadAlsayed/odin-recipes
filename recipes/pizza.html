                Prepare the dough: Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
                After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead the dough: Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
                Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.
                If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.
                The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.
                At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.

                Pre-heat the pizza stone: Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough into balls: Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flatten the dough balls and stretch them into round shapes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your toppings to the pizza.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place your pizza and bake it in a 475°F oven until the crust is browned.
            </li>
        </ol>
